bio: "Under the name Untold Stories, Ruben Pater creates visual narratives that support solidarity, justice and equality. The aim is to reach a wide audience through images, printed media, interactive media and film.
His “Drone Survival Guide” (2013) received worldwide attention as a discussion piece on military drones. In his book “The Politics of Design” (BIS, 2016) he looks at the responsabilities of designers in visual culture. His last book “CAPS LOCK” (Valiz, 2021) is a reference work that uses clear language and visual examples to show how graphic design and capitalism have come to be inextricably linked. Pater teaches at graphic design department at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague. Ruben Pater teaches at both the master and the bachelor programmes of the Graphic Design department at the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague."
